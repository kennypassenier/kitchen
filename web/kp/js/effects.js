// The effects module [S45, AR34, AR35, AR44]: the reveals of the hook
// vocabulary, in one file, for both channels.
//
// A consumer marks what a passage IS — `data-kp-surface="hero"`, a
// `<mark>`, `data-kp-reveal="headline|emphasis|rule"`, `data-kp-divider`
// — and a theme decides what that looks like. This module performs the
// part a stylesheet cannot: the decipher of a headline, the clearance of
// marks one after another, the rule that draws when its heading scrolls
// into view. It toggles state classes only (STATE); the register paints.
//
// Which reveals a theme performs is the theme's answer, read from three
// custom properties on the root (`--kp-reveal-headline: decipher`, and so
// on, ROUTINES): a theme that declares none has answered quietly, and the
// module leaves the element at rest. Under formal a headline is a
// headline.
//
// Every reveal has a rest state that holds without this script: the
// register keys its start states on the root attribute `data-kp-effects`,
// which the head snippet (js/no-flash.js) sets before first paint and
// attachEffects() sets again, so a page without the module shows drawn
// rules and clear marks, and a page with it never flashes from rest to
// start [AR34].
//
// Reveals run once per session per page by default — a server-rendered
// dashboard is a full load per click, and nobody wants the heading to
// decipher on every one — and `data-kp-reveal-every="load"` opts back in
// [AR44]. The memo is sessionStorage, key per path and hook, the module's
// only storage (M4).
//
// Nothing here throws. An unknown surface or reveal value is reported
// once per page as `kp-effect-unknown` with the accepted values, and
// js/diagnostics.js lists it. Reduced motion, at attach or mid-session,
// resolves every running reveal to its rest state at once [DI7].

//   import { attachEffects } from '@kp-soft/themes/js/effects';
//   const effects = attachEffects(document, { threshold: 0.6 });

//
// DI5: every animation the register runs has its row in TIMINGS below,

// and reports every rate (S42: reported, never corrected by the gate).
