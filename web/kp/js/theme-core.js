// The theme state, owned by the document rather than by either channel
// [AR5, AR6, TH26].
//
// The React hook used to keep the current theme and its subscriber list in
// module state. A plain <script> cannot reach a React module's closure, so
// on the comparison page the two pickers would each set the theme
// correctly and each fail to update the other's selection mark — on the
// very surface built to compare them.
//
// So: the truth is `document.documentElement.dataset.theme`, and a change
// is announced as one DOM event both channels listen to. Cross-tab
// following rides the same bus, because a `storage` event is translated
// into the same announcement.
//
// This file is plain ESM with no dependencies. React sits on top of it,
// not underneath.
//
// Since 3.0.0 [KT6]: where the theme lives is a choice — the root
// element, the class that marks a dark theme and the storage key are
// settable once with configureTheme() or per call; a change can be
// refused by a listener on BEFORE_THEME_EVENT; the change event bubbles
// from the root so a scoped listener can catch it; a strict apply
// reports an unknown name instead of silently substituting the default;
// and the cross-tab subscription can be declined.
