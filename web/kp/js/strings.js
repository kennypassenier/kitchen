// Every user-visible string this package can produce [KT5].
//
// The fault this closes, in Kenny's words: "Wij bieden de basis, de
// consumenten vullen de inhoud in." Until 2.0.0 every component spoke
// hardcoded Dutch in both channels, so an English consumer could adopt
// exactly the components that carry no text — and that was measurably
// the case: JobTracker took Button, Badge, Card, Alert, Health,
// EmptyState and Toasts, which are precisely the files with a zero in
// the count. Everything from round two, including the DataTable and the
// forms Kenny had asked for, was unreachable.
//
// **The fault is not "Dutch strings".** It is a user-visible string with
// no way in from outside, which the JobTracker session named more
// precisely than the first version of the correction did. A Dutch app
// that wants "Overnemen" where this says "Opslaan" is just as stuck, and
// translating everything to English would leave the same defect wearing
// a different word. So the shape of the fix is a way IN, and the default
// language is a separate decision that happens to be English.
//
// Screen-reader-only text is in here too, and that is the half that
// matters most. `Copyable` already took its visible labels as props and
// kept its announcement hardcoded, so an English page said one thing on
// screen and another to a screen reader. Half-translatable is worse than
// untranslatable: it fails silently, and only for the people who cannot
// see that it failed.
//
// Three ways to supply your own, all of them optional:
//
//   import { setStrings } from '@kp-soft/themes/js/strings';
//   setStrings({ formRequired: 'required' });        // framework-free
//
//   <StringsProvider value={{ formRequired: 'vereist' }}>…   // React
//
//   <DataTable strings={{ tableSearch: 'Rechercher' }} />    // per use
//
// Anything not supplied falls back to the English below, so a consumer
// overrides what it cares about and nothing else.
